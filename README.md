* ‎DR-HSH017S

#### Humidifiers
* DR-HM713S

Please open an issue if you have another model that works or doesn't work. If you have another device type and can help me test some code out I would definitely be open to adding support.

## Supported Features

### Fans

* **Fan Speed:** Fan speed is displayed as a percentage value with steps that are equivalent to those of the Dreo app. (for example, a fan with speeds 1-6 will have steps at 17%, 33%, 50% etc)

* **Oscillate:** Toggles fan oscillation
* **Auto/Manual Mode:** Uses HomeKit's native fan target-state control when the fan reports modes.
* **Advanced Fan Controls (optional):** Exposes supported Dreo-only controls as separate, clearly named switch accessories. Named modes include Normal, Natural, Sleep, and Auto; preferences can include Display Auto Off and Panel Sound. HomeKit's native fan service remains the primary fan interface.
* **Temperature Sensor:** Displays current temperature sensor reading. (for supported devices, check your devices capabilities) Because the Dreo fan temperature sensors are not entirely accurate, you can also set a specific temperature offset for your devices.
* **Child Lock:** Lock physical fan controls

Advanced fan controls are disabled by default to keep the out-of-box Home interface clean. Enable **Expose Advanced Fan Controls** in the Homebridge plugin settings to add every control supported by the fan. Each control is published as an independent accessory with its own name, so it is unambiguous in Apple Home, automations, and Siri.

Apple Home can group the controls later if desired: open a control's settings, choose **Group with Other Accessories**, and select the related controls. Grouping is managed by Apple Home and may cause the grouped tiles to share the group name; the plugin cannot assign different visible tile names inside an Apple-created group.

### Heaters

#### Heaters are displayed as a thermostat accessory with the following control mappings

* **Heat Mode:** Controls Dreo 'Eco' mode
* **Cool Mode:** Controls Dreo 'Fan Only' mode
* **Auto Mode:** Controls Dreo 'Heat' speeds, represented as an offset from the minimum temperature (for example, a heater with speeds 1-3 and a minimum temp of 41F can be controlled by setting temperature to 41, 42, 43)
* **Current Temperature:** Displays current temperature sensor reading
* **Fan Speed:** Controls heater vent angle
* **Oscillate:** Toggles heater vent oscillation
* **Child Lock:** Lock physical heater controls
* **Hardware Display:** Changes temperature unit on physical hardware display

### Humidifiers

#### To see Humidifier "Water Level" and "Fog Level" in HomeKit, you will need to select `Show as Separate Tiles` in HomeKit. An then name the Switches accordingly, i.e. `Sleep Mode` & `Warm Mist`.

<div align="center" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: row;">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8b8f8f3-4625-4c04-aa62-da19016bf87f" width=200>
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9392f4d3-1499-407a-bee5-7357f16e560f" width=200>
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d56a4e8-c3ac-4975-8d80-ca65087f9b24" width=200>
</div>

* **Auto Mode:** Controls Dreo `Manual Mode`, as HomeKit hides Humidity slider in `Auto Mode`. You can adjust `Mist Level`, which reflects the Dero `Manual Mode` in the Dreo app.
* **Humidity Mode:** Controls Dreo `Auto Mode` & `Sleep Mode` mode. HomeKit do not support `Sleep Mode`, But you can switch between `Sleep Mode` and `Auto Mode` using the 'Sleep' switch in HomeKit. 
* **Fan Speed:** Controls the `Mist Level` of the humidifier. Humidifier will automatically switch to `Manual Mode` if this is adjusted in HomeKit.
* **Sleep Mode:** This is a switch that will toggle the humidifier into `Sleep Mode`. 
  * **Note**: Do not forget to rename this switch as HomeKit will name it as a `Switch` by default.
* **Warm Mist:** This is a switch turns on the humidifier's `Warm Mist`. 
  * **Note**: Do not forget to rename this switch as HomeKit will name it as a `Switch` by default.

#### Sensors
* **Humidity Sensor:** Displays current humidity sensor reading.
* **Water Level Sensor:** It's a binary sensor. Displays 100% if the Humidifier has any water in the tank. If no water, it will display 0%. Dero humidifiers do not have a water level sensor.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @simoore/homebridge-dreo-enhanced
```

(Or install through the Homebridge UI)

## Configuration

Provide your Dreo app login credentials

```json
"platforms": [
  {
    "options": {
      "email": "email@example.com",
      "password": "00000000"
    },
    "hideTemperatureSensor": false,
    "temperatureOffset": 0,
    "exposeOscillationSwitch": false,
    "exposeAdvancedFanControls": false,
    "name": "Dreo Platform",
    "platform": "DreoPlatform"
  }
]
```

Existing `exposeFanModeSwitches` and `exposeFanPreferences` settings remain supported for users who only want one subset of the advanced controls.
